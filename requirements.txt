Build a small MEAN stack application with two tabs: Property Details and Underwriting. Both tabs operate on the same property and must share data.

What We Want To Evaluate:-
Application architecture
State management across tabs
API design
Validation and edge cases
User experience

Property Details Tab:-
Fetch property data from the API.
All fields are editable except Property address.
The Broker section supports add, edit, and delete.
Show tenants in a read-only Lease Abstract.
Provide two actions:
Save → update existing record.
Save As → create a new version of the property.

Underwriting Tab:-
Manage tenants (add/edit/delete).
Based on the available space, an auto-populated row should have the vacant space information.
Total Square footage must be less than or equal to the property space.
Lease Start cannot be before the property start.
Lease End cannot exceed start + hold period.
Changes should reflect in Property Details automatically.

Important Behavior:-
Switching tabs must not lose unsaved edits.
Save should send data from both tabs in one request.
If the user tries to leave with unsaved changes, show a warning.
Need to manage the change history in a separate table with logs on how many fields are updated with old and new values.
All inputs should be properly validated.

Backend:-
Create APIs for:
You can add static JSON in database for Property.
Get property
Save Property
Save As Property
Broker and tenant operations

What To Submit:-
Source code
README with setup steps and assumptions
API document

Focus on clean design over completeness.
